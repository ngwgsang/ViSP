# A Large-Scale Benchmark for Vietnamese Sentence Paraphrases

## Introduction

Paraphrasing involves rewriting sentences with different words while preserving the original meaning. It is a vital technique in NLP, supporting various tasks such as Question Answering, Information Retrieval, Machine Translation, and Chatbots. However, Vietnamese remains a low-resource language, and existing paraphrase resources mostly focus on English or contain only small, often automatically translated Vietnamese data.

</p>

ViSP addresses this gap by providing a large-scale dataset of over 1.2 million Vietnamese sentence pairs from diverse topics. Each original sentence is accompanied by multiple paraphrases, all manually verified to ensure quality. We also evaluate various paraphrase generation methods‚Äîincluding rule-based approaches, back translation, and neural models‚Äîcomparing them against human performance to highlight their strengths and limitations.

We hope ViSP and our empirical study will serve as a foundation for future research and applications in Vietnamese paraphrasing üôå.

## Dataset

The ViSP dataset consists of 1.2M+ pairs of Vietnamese paraphrased sentences spanning various domains. Each original sentence is accompanied by multiple paraphrased versions, ensuring the semantic meaning is preserved while offering diverse expressions. Note that ViSP is intended primarily for research and analysis in Vietnamese paraphrasing, rather than fine-tuning any single downstream model.

Each ViSP sample has the following format

## Models Used in Experiments

The models used in our experiments can be found at [LINK](https://huggingface.co/collections/ngwgsang/visp-66ec240d6865fea132a3cb98).  
Below is a simple description of how we used them:

```python
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

# Set device to GPU if available, else fallback to CPU
device = 0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1

# Choose a fine-tuned model for ViSP paraphrasing
model_name = "ngwgsang/vit5-base-visp-s1"  # You can change to any other ViSP model

# Initialize the text2text generation pipeline
paraphraser = pipeline(
    "text2text-generation",
    model=model_name,
    tokenizer=model_name,
    device=device
)

# Input sentence for paraphrasing
sentence = "H·∫°nh ph√∫c l√† khi ta bi·∫øt ƒë·ªß v·ªõi nh·ªØng g√¨ m√¨nh ƒëang c√≥."

# Prepend task prefix as expected by the model
prompt = f"sentence-paraphrase: {sentence}"

# Run the model to generate paraphrases
outputs = paraphraser(
    prompt,
    max_length=96,
    num_beams=5,
    do_sample=True,
    # temperature=0.9,
    # top_k=50,
    # top_p=0.95,
    num_return_sequences=3,
    early_stopping=True
)

# Display input and generated paraphrases
print(f"Input: {sentence}\n")
print("Generated Paraphrases:")
for i, o in enumerate(outputs, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {o['generated_text']}")

# >>> Input: H·∫°nh ph√∫c l√† khi ta bi·∫øt ƒë·ªß v·ªõi nh·ªØng g√¨ m√¨nh ƒëang c√≥.
# Generated Paraphrases:
# 1. H·∫°nh ph√∫c l√† khi ta bi·∫øt tr√¢n tr·ªçng nh·ªØng g√¨ m√¨nh ƒëang c√≥.
# 2. H·∫°nh ph√∫c l√† khi ta bi·∫øt h√†i l√≤ng v·ªõi nh·ªØng g√¨ m√¨nh ƒëang c√≥.
# 3. H·∫°nh ph√∫c l√† khi ta bi·∫øt ƒë·ªß v·ªõi nh·ªØng g√¨ m√¨nh ƒëang c√≥.

The dataset was constructed using a hybrid approach that combines automatic paraphrase generation with manual evaluation to ensure high quality. We conducted experiments using methods such as back-translation, EDA, and baseline models like BART and T5, as well as large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5, Aya, Qwen-2.5, and Meta-Llama-3.1 variants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study on Vietnamese paraphrasing. We hope that our dataset and findings will serve as a valuable foundation for future research and applications in Vietnamese paraphrase tasks.
