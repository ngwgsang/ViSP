# A Large-Scale Benchmark for Vietnamese Sentence Paraphrases



## Introduction

Paraphrasing involves rewriting sentences with different words while preserving the original meaning. It is a vital technique in NLP, supporting various tasks such as Question Answering, Information Retrieval, Machine Translation, and Chatbots. However, Vietnamese remains a low-resource language, and existing paraphrase resources mostly focus on English or contain only small, often automatically translated Vietnamese data.

ViSP addresses this gap by providing a large-scale dataset of over 1.2 million Vietnamese sentence pairs from diverse topics. Each original sentence is accompanied by multiple paraphrases, all manually verified to ensure quality. We also evaluate various paraphrase generation methods‚Äîincluding rule-based approaches, back translation, and neural models‚Äîcomparing them against human performance to highlight their strengths and limitations.

We hope ViSP and our empirical study will serve as a foundation for future research and applications in Vietnamese paraphrasing üôå.

## Dataset

The ViSP dataset consists of 1.2M+ pairs of Vietnamese paraphrased sentences spanning various domains. Each original sentence is accompanied by multiple paraphrased versions, ensuring the semantic meaning is preserved while offering diverse expressions. Note that ViSP is intended primarily for research and analysis in Vietnamese paraphrasing, rather than fine-tuning any single downstream model.

Each ViSP sample has the following format
